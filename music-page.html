        It took me 20 years of singing to realize that I don't really know how to sing. I am still learning about how to sing after so many years of singing. I am now working
        on being more self-aware when it comes to improving my technique, to make it more consistent while learning to push my vocal range and delivery to its limits.

      <p class="text1">
        I have been singing all my life, playing guitar for 7 years (on and off) and rapping for 14 years. I have been an avid music listener all my life. My biggest inspirations
        for singing are my father, sister, grand father and my Irish friend Nicky Wicks. I see the beauty in all music, irrespective of genre and without prejudice for the artist. I believe in
        the saying 'Its about what you say, but also more about how you say it', and for all the right reasons.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text1">
        Almost all my music influence I derive from family and friends. It ranges from Carnatic music to contemporary Indian music to indie rock to hip-hop
        music. Throughout my life I have been exposed to music from various cultures, languages and genres. You can find my
        music playlists <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCIex_pbhEkNipCZRoU3cQPA?si=Yui213f1XevTDh5B">here</a>.

          Original Music
        </p>

        <p class="text1">
          For my original music projects, I also go by the name 4 Dimensional. I wrote, recorded, mixed and produced an album with 7 tracks in the indie rock
          and hip-hop genres in 2020. I recorded using basic equipment and at home over the Corona virus pandemic in 2020. Reaper is my preferred DAW because
          of its flexibility, simplicity, efficiency and expandability. I am extremely thankful to Damo for doing the entire recording and production of one of
          the songs, Ashok sir (my former guitar teacher) and my friends and family for their patience and feedback.

              I made a video for the song "Same Things" from the album, which is the song that Damo recorded and produced for me. It was the first song I wrote.
              The video was made using Windows Media Player (while it still existed). It's a collection of images and videos of my high-school days.

          Jazz Cafe Bebop, Delft Jam Session - 20/02/2024

        <p class="text1">
          I always wanted to explore the jazz scene after coming to Europe. The technicality of jazz music with all the instruments
          is super interesting and satisfying. I spend my time sometimes at the jam sessions at Cafe Le Duc in Den Haag and the Jazz Cafe Bebop
          here in Delft.

              I always thought jazz musicians would be super arrogant and strict, but these guys actually were pretty chill. We jammed to
              a Chet Baker and Frank Sinatra song and the crowd enjoyed it. There's more to come here.

              Although I have been to quite a few jazz jam sessions in Delft and Den Haag, this is the first one I dared to perform at. Bart, the
              trumpet player is actually in a really cool jazz band called <a href="https://beatsbybunker.nl/">BUNKER</a>. Those guys really take things

          I am grateful to have met and played with so many cool musicians. Its always a fun experience busking as the world becomes your stage. The
          children almost always stop and stare in awe, with their parents acknowledging the happy moment. There are awesome spontaneous moments
          and interesting characters to meet. It is wholesome to see the local businesses and the general public all appreciate and support each
          other after the cold winter.

              I wanted to represent my part of India by singing a Tamil song. I sang a film song called 'Maruvaarthai' by Sid Sriram. It has
              wonderful intricacies with the melodies, pitch variation and control, characteristic of Carnatic Music. I also rapped the song
              'Feel' by Kendrick Lamar, a simply eye-opening great song by a Pulitzer award winning literary genius.

          The Base Festival is a yearly festival for all the incoming students of TU Delft. All the student associations of TU Delft collaborate
          to make it happen. 2021 was my first year here and ever in a foreign country. We performed as 'The Eleventh Hour Band'. I had
          my first ever encore performance here. The crowd was constantly amused and our final song was a rendition of an Indian film song that
          they couldn't get enough of. We upped the energy level at a steady rate, with our song selection, from start to finish.
